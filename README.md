<h4>About Event</h4>

Participants will be given an issue as a feature to develop in the web development template. Issues will be opened in github repository at a time specified earlier in the whatsapp group. Once going through the issues published participants must request the issue to be assigned to them. We check the participants github when there are many requests and assign an issue to a single participant only. Once assigned participants must solve that issue within 48 hours and make a pull request to repository from the branch. Our repo maintainers will go through the pull request thoroughly and can merge once satisfied all the rules mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/GameofSource-GFG/Android-Development/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> file. If a participant is failed to make pull request and didn't show any prorgress on that issue within 24 hours, the issue will be cancelled and we assign that issue to another participant.
